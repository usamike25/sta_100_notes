## Chapter 4: Measurable Spaces

### 4.1 Families of Measurable Sets

#### **4.1.1 σ-fields**

**Definition 4.1: σ-field**
Let $\Omega$ be a non-empty set. A family of subsets $\mathcal{F}$ of $\Omega$ is called a **σ-field** (or σ-algebra) on $\Omega$ if it satisfies:
(i) The entire set is in the family: $\Omega \in \mathcal{F}$.
(ii) It is closed under complementation: If $A \in \mathcal{F}$, then its complement $A^c = \Omega \setminus A$ is also in $\mathcal{F}$.
(iii) It is closed under countable unions: If $\{A_i : i \in \mathbb{N}\}$ is a collection of sets where each $A_i \in \mathcal{F}$, then their union $\cup_{i \in \mathbb{N}} A_i$ is also in $\mathcal{F}$.

**Remarks & Properties:**
* From the definition, a σ-field $\mathcal{F}$ must also contain the empty set $\emptyset$, since $\Omega \in \mathcal{F}$ and $\emptyset = \Omega^c$.
* A σ-field is closed under countable intersections. If $\{A_i : i \in \mathbb{N}\} \subset \mathcal{F}$, then $\cap_{i \in \mathbb{N}} A_i = (\cup_{i \in \mathbb{N}} A_i^c)^c$, which is in $\mathcal{F}$.

**Examples of σ-fields:**
1.  **Trivial σ-field:** $\mathcal{F} = \{\emptyset, \Omega\}$. This is the smallest possible σ-field on any set $\Omega$.
2.  **Power Set:** $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ (the set of all subsets of $\Omega$). This is the largest possible σ-field.

---

**Definition 4.2: Measurable Space & Measurable Set**
* A pair $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$, where $\Omega$ is a set and $\mathcal{F}$ is a σ-field on $\Omega$, is called a **measurable space**.
* A set $A$ is said to be **measurable** if $A \in \mathcal{F}$.

---

#### **4.1.2 σ-fields Generated by Families of Sets**

**Proposition 4.1: Generated σ-field**
Let $\mathcal{G}$ be any family of subsets of $\Omega$. There exists a unique, smallest σ-field, denoted $\sigma(\mathcal{G})$, that contains $\mathcal{G}$. It is defined as the intersection of all σ-fields on $\Omega$ that contain $\mathcal{G}$.
$$\sigma(\mathcal{G}) = \bigcap \{\mathcal{U} : \mathcal{U} \text{ is a } \sigma\text{-field on } \Omega \text{ and } \mathcal{G} \subset \mathcal{U}\}$$
$\sigma(\mathcal{G})$ is called the **σ-field generated by** $\mathcal{G}$.

---

#### **4.1.3 Borel Sets of Real Coordinate Spaces**

**Definition 4.3 & 4.4: Borel σ-field**
* The **Borel σ-field on the real numbers**, denoted $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$, is the σ-field generated by the family of all open (or closed, or half-open) intervals in $\mathbb{R}$.
* The **Borel σ-field on** $\mathbb{R}^k$, denoted $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^k)$, is the σ-field generated by the family of all open rectangles in $\mathbb{R}^k$.
* The elements of a Borel σ-field are called **Borel sets**.

## Chapter 5: Measure Spaces

### 5.1 The Notion of a Measure

**Definition 5.1: Measure**
Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ be a measurable space. A function $\mu: \mathcal{F} \to [0, \infty]$ is a **measure** if it satisfies:
(i) The measure of the empty set is zero: $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$.
(ii) **Countable Additivity (or σ-additivity):** For any countable collection of pairwise disjoint sets $\{A_i : i \in \mathbb{N}\} \subset \mathcal{F}$, the measure of their union is the sum of their measures:
$$\mu\left(\bigcup_{i \in \mathbb{N}} A_i\right) = \sum_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mu(A_i)$$

**Definition 5.2: Measure Space**
A triple $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ consisting of a set $\Omega$, a σ-field $\mathcal{F}$ on $\Omega$, and a measure $\mu$ on $\mathcal{F}$, is called a **measure space**.

#### **Examples of Measures**

1.  **Point (Dirac) Measure:** For a given point $x \in \Omega$, $\delta_x(A) = 1$ if $x \in A$ and $0$ otherwise.
2.  **Counting Measure:** Defined on $(\Omega, \mathcal{P}(\Omega))$, $\mu(A) = \#A$ (the number of elements in $A$).
3.  **Lebesgue Measure ($\lambda$):** A unique measure on $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$ that assigns to any interval its length.

#### **5.1.3 Properties of a Measure**
* **Monotonicity:** If $A \subset B$, then $\mu(A) \le \mu(B)$.
* **Continuity from Below:** If $A_n \uparrow A$, then $\mu(A_n) \uparrow \mu(A)$.
* **Continuity from Above:** If $A_n \downarrow A$ and $\mu(A_1) < \infty$, then $\mu(A_n) \downarrow \mu(A)$.
* **Countable Subadditivity:** For any collection $\{A_i\}$, $\mu(\cup_i A_i) \le \sum_i \mu(A_i)$.

### 5.2 Semirings

**Definition 5.3: Semiring**
A family of subsets $\mathcal{A}$ of $\Omega$ is a **semiring** if it satisfies:
(i) $\emptyset \in \mathcal{A}$.
(ii) It is closed under finite intersections: If $A, B \in \mathcal{A}$, then $A \cap B \in \mathcal{A}$.
(iii) The difference of two sets can be written as a finite disjoint union of sets in the family.

## Chapter 6: From Outer Measure to Measure

This chapter describes how to construct a measure on a σ-field, like the Lebesgue measure.

**Key Concepts**
1.  **Outer Measure ($\mu^*$):** A function on $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ that is non-negative, zero for $\emptyset$, monotone, and countably subadditive.
2.  **Carathéodory's Criterion:** An outer measure $\mu^*$ can be restricted to a σ-field of "**$\mu^*$-measurable sets**" to become a true measure. A set $A$ is $\mu^*$-measurable if $\mu^*(E) = \mu^*(E \cap A) + \mu^*(E \cap A^c)$ for all $E \subset \Omega$.
3.  **Carathéodory's Extension Theorem:** A finitely additive and countably subadditive function $\rho$ on a semiring $\mathcal{A}$ can be extended to a unique measure on the generated σ-field $\sigma(\mathcal{A})$.
4.  **Uniqueness of Lebesgue Measure:** The Lebesgue measure $\lambda$ is the unique measure on $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$ that satisfies $\lambda((a,b]) = b-a$.

## Chapter 7: Measurable Functions

### 7.1 The Concept of Measurable Functions

**Definition 7.1: Measurable Function**
Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ and $(\Omega^*, \mathcal{F}^*)$ be two measurable spaces. A function $f: \Omega \to \Omega^*$ is **measurable** (specifically, $\mathcal{F}/\mathcal{F}^*$ measurable) if the pre-image of every measurable set in the target space is a measurable set in the domain space.
$$\forall A^* \in \mathcal{F}^*, \quad f^{-1}(A^*) = \{\omega \in \Omega : f(\omega) \in A^*\} \in \mathcal{F}$$

**Proposition 7.1: A Simpler Criterion for Measurability**
If $\mathcal{F}^* = \sigma(\mathcal{G})$ for some family of sets $\mathcal{G}$, then $f$ is measurable if and only if $f^{-1}(G) \in \mathcal{F}$ for all $G \in \mathcal{G}$.

**Key Types of Measurable Functions**
* **Borel Function:** A function $f: \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^k$ that is $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^m)/\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^k)$ measurable.
* **Real-Valued Measurable Function:** A function $f: (\Omega, \mathcal{F}) \to (\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$. It is sufficient to check that sets of the form $\{\omega: f(\omega) \le x\}$ are in $\mathcal{F}$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
* **Indicator Function:** The function $\mathbb{1}_A(\omega)$ is $\mathcal{F}$-measurable if and only if the set $A \in \mathcal{F}$.

**Properties of Measurable Functions**
* **Compositions:** The composition of measurable functions is measurable.
* **Continuous Functions:** Any continuous function $f: \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^k$ is a Borel function.
* **Algebraic Operations:** If $f, g: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ are measurable, then so are $f+g$, $fg$, $cf$ (for $c \in \mathbb{R}$), $\max\{f, g\}$, $\min\{f, g\}$, and $|f|$.
* **Limits:** If $\{f_n\}$ is a sequence of measurable functions, then $\sup f_n$, $\inf f_n$, $\limsup f_n$, and $\liminf f_n$ are all measurable. If $f_n \to f$ pointwise, then $f$ is also measurable.

### 7.1.1 Simple Functions

**Definition 7.3: Simple Function**
A function $f: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ is **simple** if it takes only a finite number of values. It can always be written as a finite linear combination of indicator functions:
$$f(\omega) = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i \mathbb{1}_{A_i}(\omega)$$
A simple function is measurable if all its carrier sets $A_i$ are measurable.

**Proposition 7.10 & 7.11: Approximation by Simple Functions**
* Any non-negative measurable function $f$ is the pointwise limit of a monotonically increasing sequence of non-negative simple measurable functions.
* Any measurable function $f: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ is the pointwise limit of a sequence of simple measurable functions.

### 7.3 Minimal Measurability

**σ-field Generated by a Function**
The σ-field generated by a function $f: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^k$ is the smallest σ-field on $\Omega$ that makes $f$ measurable. It is given by:
$$\sigma(f) = \{f^{-1}(B) : B \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^k)\}$$

**Proposition 7.13: Doob-Dynkin Lemma**
Let $f: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^k$ be a function. A function $h: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ is $\sigma(f)$-measurable if and only if there exists a Borel measurable function $g: \mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $h = g(f)$.

## Chapter 8: Integration (First Part)

### 8.1 The Integral for Nonnegative Functions

**Definition 8.3: The Integral**
For a non-negative measurable function $f: (\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu) \to [0, \infty]$, the integral is defined as:
$$\int_{\Omega} f(\omega) \mu(d\omega) = \sup \left\{ \sum_{A \in \xi} \inf_{\omega \in A} f(\omega) \mu(A) : \xi \text{ is a finite measurable partition of } \Omega \right\}$$

**Integral of a Simple Function:** For a non-negative simple function $f = \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_i \mathbb{1}_{A_i}$ in standard form, the integral is:
$$\int_{\Omega} f \,d\mu = \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_i \mu(A_i)$$

**Proposition 8.2: Monotone Convergence Theorem (MCT)**
If $\{f_n\}$ is a sequence of non-negative measurable functions such that $f_n(\omega) \uparrow f(\omega)$ for all $\omega$, then:
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \int f_n \,d\mu = \int f \,d\mu$$

**Proposition 8.3: Linearity**
For non-negative measurable functions $f,g$ and $\alpha, \beta \ge 0$:
$$\int (\alpha f + \beta g) \,d\mu = \alpha \int f \,d\mu + \beta \int g \,d\mu$$

**Definition 8.4: Almost Everywhere (a.e.)**
A property holds **$\mu$-almost everywhere** if the set of points where it fails has measure zero.

### 8.2 Integrable Functions

**Positive and Negative Parts:** $f = f^+ - f^-$ where $f^+ = \max\{f, 0\}$ and $f^- = \max\{-f, 0\}$.

**Definition 8.5: Integral of a Real-Valued Function**
For a measurable function $f: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$, its integral is defined as:
$$\int f \,d\mu = \int f^+ \,d\mu - \int f^- \,d\mu$$
provided at least one of the integrals on the right is finite. The function $f$ is **integrable** if both are finite.

**Proposition 8.6: Integrability Criterion**
A measurable function $f$ is integrable if and only if $\int |f| \,d\mu < \infty$.

### 8.3 Limit Theorems

**Proposition 8.9: Fatou's Lemma**
For any sequence $\{f_n\}$ of non-negative measurable functions:
$$\int (\liminf_{n \to \infty} f_n) \,d\mu \le \liminf_{n \to \infty} \int f_n \,d\mu$$

**Proposition 8.10: Lebesgue's Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT)**
Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of measurable functions such that:
1.  $f_n(\omega) \to f(\omega)$ a.e.
2.  There exists an integrable function $g$ such that $|f_n(\omega)| \le g(\omega)$ a.e. for all $n$.
Then $f$ is integrable and:
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \int f_n \,d\mu = \int f \,d\mu = \int (\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n) \,d\mu$$

### 8.4 Integration over Measurable Sets

**Definition 8.6:** The integral of $f$ over a set $A \in \mathcal{F}$ is defined as:
$$\int_A f \,d\mu = \int f \cdot \mathbb{1}_A \,d\mu$$

***

## Chapter 9: Integration (Second Part)

### 9.1 Pushforward Measure

**Definition 9.1: Pushforward Measure**
Let $\mu$ be a measure on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ and $g: (\Omega, \mathcal{F}) \to (\Omega^*, \mathcal{F}^*)$ be a measurable function. The **pushforward measure** $\mu_{g^{-1}}$ (or simply $\mu_g$) on $(\Omega^*, \mathcal{F}^*)$ is defined by:
$$\mu_{g^{-1}}(A^*) = \mu(g^{-1}(A^*)) \quad \text{for any } A^* \in \mathcal{F}^*$$

**Proposition 9.1: Change of Variables Formula**
Let $f: (\Omega^*, \mathcal{F}^*) \to \mathbb{R}$ be a measurable function that is either non-negative or integrable with respect to $\mu_{g^{-1}}$. Then $f \circ g$ is either non-negative or integrable with respect to $\mu$, and:
$$\int_{\Omega^*} f(y) \, \mu_{g^{-1}}(dy) = \int_{\Omega} f(g(\omega)) \, \mu(d\omega)$$

### 9.2 Densities

**Definition 9.2: Density**
Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ be a measure space. A non-negative measurable function $\phi: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ is a **density** (or Radon-Nikodym derivative) of a measure $\nu$ with respect to a measure $\mu$ if:
$$\nu(A) = \int_A \phi(\omega) \, \mu(d\omega) \quad \text{for all } A \in \mathcal{F}$$
This is often written as $d\nu = \phi \, d\mu$ or $\frac{d\nu}{d\mu} = \phi$.

**Proposition 9.3: Integration with a Density**
If $\nu$ has density $\phi$ with respect to $\mu$, then for any non-negative or $\nu$-integrable function $f$:
$$\int f \,d\nu = \int f \cdot \phi \,d\mu$$
